Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,is the set in Python how we can create,0,60
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,we will work around its operations using,0,60
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,its built-in methods python set,0,60
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,basically part of collections in Python,0,60
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,okay that means list tuples dictionary,0,60
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,and set are the four built-in data types,0,60
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,in Python which are used to store,0,60
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,collections of data okay whenever you,0,60
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,create a set the items are are placed,0,60
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,inside curly braces and they are,0,60
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,separated by comma python set unordered,0,60
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,and unchangeable okay unchangeable but,0,60
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,you can add a new item to an already,0,60
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,credit set with that you can also remove,0,60
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,an item from a set okay and remember,0,60
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,that duplicate values aren't allowed in,0,60
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,a set if you will add duplicate values,0,60
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,and print it only a single value will,0,60
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,get printed let's see,0,60
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,at first we will create a setting python,0,60
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,I told you to create a set the elements,0,60
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,are placed inside curly brackets which,0,60
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,are separated by comma okay so let's see,0,60
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,how to create a set,0,60
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,hey spychom let us create a new project,60,120
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,file new project,60,120
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,click on create,60,120
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,we have created a set right click and,60,120
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,create a new file python file demo press,60,120
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,enter it will convert to demo.pa that,60,120
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,that is our python file,60,120
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,our first example is how we can create a,60,120
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,set in Python,60,120
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,okay at first take a set object you can,60,120
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,add any name for this,60,120
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,curly braces I told you and just add,60,120
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,values in it,60,120
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,so herein we added five items in our set,60,120
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,separated by comma and enclosed by curly,60,120
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,brackets I told you I'll print it easily,60,120
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,using this print method,60,120
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,that's it you have created your first,60,120
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,set in Python right click and run here,60,120
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,it is we have printed it,60,120
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,okay so I told you that,60,120
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,python set are an ordered that means the,120,180
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,items will appear in a random order okay,120,180
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,so with that guys we will work around,120,180
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,all these examples that will complete,120,180
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,your python side concept,120,180
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,from scratch to the end let's begin,120,180
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,so we saw how we can create a set in,120,180
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,Python let's see the second example,120,180
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,now we will see how to create a set,120,180
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,with different data types,120,180
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,okay let me create a set again,120,180
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,so I have created this set again and,120,180
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,printed it,120,180
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,now let me create a second set,120,180
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,within that I'll add,120,180
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,integer values,120,180
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,okay I'll print this,120,180
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,now let me create another set with the,120,180
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,Boolean values,120,180
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,true true false,180,240
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,two,180,240
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,false okay,180,240
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,print it,180,240
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,right click run here you can see we,180,240
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,created first second and third I told,180,240
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,you it is unordered that is the result,180,240
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,will be in random order,180,240
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,now create a new set we will now create,180,240
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,a single set with different data types,180,240
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,okay so for that,180,240
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,let me first add a string,180,240
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,then let me add a Boolean,180,240
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,a number,180,240
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,number again let's say then I'll add,180,240
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,string again,180,240
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,and let's say string again so now we,180,240
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,have,180,240
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,our,180,240
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,set with different data types I'll just,180,240
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,print it,180,240
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,and that's it right click and run let's,180,240
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,see what will happen it will display in,180,240
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,random order,180,240
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,right displayed in random order so in,240,300
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,this way you can create a set with,240,300
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,different data types okay now moving,240,300
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,further,240,300
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,now let us see how we can,240,300
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,Loop through a set,240,300
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,Loop through the set and print all the,240,300
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,values,240,300
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,Loop through the set and print all the,240,300
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,values,240,300
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,for this we'll be using a for Loop,240,300
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,let us create a set first,240,300
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,we created it and normally printed it,240,300
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,and now we will print it using Loop we,240,300
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,will Loop through the set let's say for,240,300
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,I in the set name set object my set and,240,300
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,just print the value of,240,300
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,I here that's it add a colon here and,240,300
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,right click and run it,240,300
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,all right and you can see we printed we,240,300
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,we iterated and we printed one by one we,240,300
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,printed all the values one by one in,240,300
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,this way you can also Loop through the,240,300
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,set and print all the values,240,300
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,now let us see another example,300,360
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,here and what we will do we will get the,300,360
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,length of a set,300,360
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,to get the length of a set,300,360
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,we will use the alien method let's see,300,360
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,at first we will create a set,300,360
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,so we created a set with the string,300,360
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,values,300,360
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,we printed it now let us print the,300,360
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,length I told you we'll be using the Len,300,360
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,method,300,360
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,and within that enter the set object,300,360
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,name that's it right click and run the,300,360
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,output should be five there are five,300,360
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,string values,300,360
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,here it is output is 5. in this way you,300,360
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,can get the length of a set,300,360
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,next example,300,360
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,now we will see how we can access items,300,360
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,in Python set,300,360
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,to access items,300,360
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,so in Python set you cannot use an index,300,360
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,to access items but with that you can,300,360
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,use a loop to Loop through the set and,300,360
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,print the values with that you can also,360,420
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,check if a value is present in the set,360,420
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,or not,360,420
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,so let's see at first we will create a,360,420
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,set we created a set now let us print it,360,420
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,so we used a for Loop to print the set,360,420
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,now let's say we want to check for a,360,420
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,specific value for that,360,420
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,just choose print and within that we,360,420
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,will check using the in operator let's,360,420
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,say I want to check for Amit,360,420
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,so I'll just write Amit in,360,420
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,the set name that's it if true is,360,420
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,returned that means the value is in the,360,420
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,set,360,420
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,else false will get returned,360,420
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,I ran it you can see it printed the set,360,420
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,first one by one using the for Loop then,360,420
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,it has given us true why because Amit,360,420
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,text is in the set now let me add some,360,420
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,other word which is not in the set let's,360,420
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,say Jacob,360,420
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,I'll right click and run and it will,360,420
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,display false here it is it displayed,360,420
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,false that means Jacob is not in my set,360,420
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,let's move further,420,480
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,now we will see how we can add an item,420,480
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,to a python set I told you it is,420,480
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,unchangeable but you can still add an,420,480
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,item,420,480
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,the items can be added using the add,420,480
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,method,420,480
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,create a set we created a set then we,420,480
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,printed it,420,480
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,to add item use the add method,420,480
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,so write the set name the set object,420,480
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,the set object dot add and within that,420,480
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,enter the value you want to add let's,420,480
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,have I want to add Jacob if you want to,420,480
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,add multiple values add like this KT,420,480
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,okay now you can print,420,480
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,updated set,420,480
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,updated set and right click run let's,420,480
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,see what will happen,420,480
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,let's see what will happen here and you,480,540
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,can see we had five values now we have,480,540
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,seven values in random order I told you,480,540
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,set is unordered so the output will be,480,540
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,in random order okay in this way you can,480,540
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,also add an item to a python set let's,480,540
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,move further,480,540
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,foreign,480,540
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,s from another set into the current set,480,540
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,that is updating a set,480,540
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,for that use the update method simply,480,540
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,let us create two set,480,540
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,I'll be creating the first set,480,540
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,I created first set and printed it now,480,540
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,I'll create a second set,480,540
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,okay then I'll update the first set,480,540
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,okay I,540,600
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,okay I have created the second set now,540,600
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,what I'll do I'll update the first set,540,600
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,for that write the first set dot update,540,600
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,and within that mention the set two,540,600
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,that's it,540,600
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,after that print the set one because we,540,600
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,have updated the set one you can write,540,600
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,here updated set one,540,600
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,okay okay I've written updated set one,540,600
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,and printed it right click run let's see,540,600
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,what will happen at first we have,540,600
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,printed set one then set 2 then the,540,600
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,updated set one now the set one,540,600
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,set one was having five elements this is,540,600
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,having three so,540,600
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,the updated set one will have eight,540,600
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,elements okay in this way you can easily,540,600
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,add items from another set into the,540,600
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,current set to update the current set,540,600
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,now let us move further and see how we,540,600
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,can remove how we can remove an item,540,600
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,from the set using the remove method,540,600
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,to remove an item,600,660
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,as I have written here I will be using,600,660
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,the remove method let's create a set,600,660
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,first,600,660
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,so I've created a set and printed it now,600,660
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,I'll remove it using the remove method,600,660
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,it's easy let's mention the same myset,600,660
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,the myset object dot remove and within,600,660
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,that just mention name,600,660
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,the element you want to remove let's say,600,660
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,I wanted to remove I want to remove gain,600,660
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,and that's it now when you will print,600,660
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,the updated set it will show you all the,600,660
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,elements except Kane,600,660
Python Sets Tutorial | Tutorial for Beginners  | Lecture 21 | Amit Thinks,so here it is I have printed the updated,600,660
